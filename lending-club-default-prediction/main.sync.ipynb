       "549891    I currently have a loan out with CashCall. The interest rate is 96%! At the time I took out the loan, it helped with a family crisis, but now the interest is crazy to be paying. I'd rather be paying my $200 a month to pay down a loan rather than just the interest.   Also, the remainder of my debt has interest rates ranging from 20 - 24%. This includes credit cards, a student loan, and some personal loans. So, I would like to consolidate the rest of my debt and pay a lower interest rate of 15%.  By doing this, I could lower my interest and my monthly payments and save at least $4000 over the next few years.  I do have a bankruptcy that was discharged 3 years ago due to having $40,000 in debt from an uninsured hospital stay. However, I've not missed a payment on anything since.  My credit report does from time time to time relist things as collections and then I have to dispute them as included in bankruptcy and they go back to being listed that way. I'm not sure why the status gets messed up sometimes.   Thank you for your time and consideration! \n",
