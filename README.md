### [Multi-label dataset train/test split](./multi_label_dataset_split)
Splitting a multi-label dataset into train and test sets, ensuring that all
labels are represented in both sets, using [scikit-multilearn](http://scikit.ml/).
<br />
Used it to find the 10 images to use in a questionaire about human `Perception of Anthropomorphic Traits in Cars`.

### [Customer Clustering](./customer-clustering)
Using [this customer segmentation dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis) from Kaggle, I performed a customer segmentation analysis using K-means clustering.
<br />
The notebook contains the EDA, data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and
the final model, as well as a statistical analysis of the clusters and some
actionable insights.
